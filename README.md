## What is We0

![alt text](./docs/img/image-1.png)

## What Makes We0 Different?

Currently, Cursor, v0, and Bolt.new have impressive performance in web project generation. The We0 project has the following features:

Supports browser-based debugging: Built-in WebContainer environment allows you to run a terminal in the browser, install and run npm and tool libraries.

High-fidelity design restoration: Utilizes cutting-edge D2C technology to achieve 90% design restoration.

Supports importing historical projects: Unlike Bolt.new, which runs in a browser environment, We0 can directly open existing historical projects for secondary editing and debugging.

Integrates with WeChat Mini Program Developer Tools: Allows direct preview and debugging by clicking to launch the WeChat Developer Tools.

Multi-platform support: Supports Windows and Mac operating systems for client downloads, as well as web container scenarios, allowing you to choose the appropriate terminal based on usage scenarios.
